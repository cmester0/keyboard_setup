# Switching and Toggling Layers :id=switching-and-toggling-layers 

# These functions allow you to activate layers in various ways. Note that layers are not generally independent layouts -- multiple layers can be activated at once, and it's typical for layers to use KC_TRNS to allow keypresses to pass through to lower layers. When using momentary layer switching with MO(), LM(), TT(), or LT(), make sure to leave the key on the above layers transparent or it may not work as intended.

# DF(layer) - switches the default layer. The default layer is the always-active base layer that other layers stack on top of. See below for more about the default layer. This might be used to switch from QWERTY to Dvorak layout. (Note that this is a temporary switch that only persists until the keyboard loses power. To modify the default layer in a persistent way requires deeper customization, such as calling the set_single_persistent_default_layer function inside of process_record_user.)
# MO(layer) - momentarily activates layer. As soon as you let go of the key, the layer is deactivated.
# LM(layer, mod) - Momentarily activates layer (like MO), but with modifier(s) mod active. Only supports layers 0-15 and the left modifiers: MOD_LCTL, MOD_LSFT, MOD_LALT, MOD_LGUI (note the use of MOD_ constants instead of KC_). These modifiers can be combined using bitwise OR, e.g. LM(_RAISE, MOD_LCTL | MOD_LALT).
# LT(layer, kc) - momentarily activates layer when held, and sends kc when tapped. Only supports layers 0-15.
# OSL(layer) - momentarily activates layer until the next key is pressed. See One Shot Keys for details and additional functionality.
# TG(layer) - toggles layer, activating it if it's inactive and vice versa
# TO(layer) - activates layer and de-activates all other layers (except your default layer). This function is special, because instead of just adding/removing one layer to your active layer stack, it will completely replace your current active layers, uniquely allowing you to replace higher layers with a lower one. This is activated on keydown (as soon as the key is pressed).
# TT(layer) - Layer Tap-Toggle. If you hold the key down, layer is activated, and then is de-activated when you let go (like MO). If you repeatedly tap it, the layer will be toggled on or off (like TG). It needs 5 taps by default, but you can change this by defining TAPPING_TOGGLE -- for example, #define TAPPING_TOGGLE 2 to toggle on just two taps.

# OS(_): Layer switching - One shot
# OSM(_): Momentarily hold down mod. You must use the MOD_* keycodes as shown in Mod Tap, not the KC_* codes.
# OSL(_): Momentary switch to layer.
